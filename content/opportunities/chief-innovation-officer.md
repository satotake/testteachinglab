**Who We Are**

Teaching Lab is a nonprofit organization with a mission to fundamentally shift the paradigm of teacher professional learning for educational equity. We envision a world where teachers and students thrive together in communities that enable life-long learning and meaningful lives.In partnership with teachers, we transform professional learning from the ground up to dramatically improve student outcomes. We also work with school, district, and state leaders to create the instructional systems necessary to support these changes.

Our model is based on the best educational research and years of experience using exceptional instructional materials with teachers. Our team of experienced educators is committed to ensuring all students—especially students traditionally underserved by our school systems—meet the academic expectations necessary to succeed now and in the future. Our partners believe in the power of great teaching to inspire students at all levels to learn and grow. Together, we are building a nationwide movement for evidence-based teacher professional learning.

The core of Teaching Lab’s work is a belief that stronger professional learning for teachers can dramatically improve student opportunities and educational equity. Research suggests that effective professional learning incorporates three critical components:

* **Head**: Core academic content embedded in exceptional instructional materials and aligned to research-based practices. Teachers deserve daily access to instructional practices based in research. Deep study of high-quality instructional materials allows teachers to grow their knowledge over time and spread that knowledge to their colleagues. We call this the “head” of professional learning.
* **Heart**: Teacher-led communities that build both social capital and buy-in. Teachers deserve to feel motivated and supported by their peers to learn and grow. In teacher-led communities, educators are more likely to buy in to their own development and work collaboratively with their colleagues to improve instruction. We call this the “heart” of professional learning.
* **Habits**: Structured and repeated cycles of learning in the classroom. Teachers deserve to learn from their efforts. Repeated cycles of learning afford teachers the time and space to reflect, incorporate new learning into practice, and verify changes to instruction using evidence of student learning. We call this the “habits” of professional learning.

At Teaching Lab, our work is in pursuit of **racial educational equity**, and our lived values are grounded in **racial equity**.

* **Racial educational equity** is “raising the achievement of all students, while eliminating the racial predictability and disproportionality of which student groups occupy the highest and lowest achievement categories.” (Adapted from Pacific Educational Group)
* **Racial equity** is the active work to ensure that colleagues of all racial backgrounds are truly respected, are able to function with dignity, are able to exercise influence over their lives, and, in the end, be able to determine for themselves the course of their professional realities. (Adapted from Howard Fuller)
